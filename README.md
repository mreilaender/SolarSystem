# SolarSystem
This repository represents a Solar System based on Pyglet, which uses pyopengl.

# Movement
W     ... Move forward
A     ... Move left
S     ... Move backwards
D     ... Move right
SPACE ... Move up
LCTRL ... Move down

# Usage
To run this application, you need to have Python version 3.5 installed. The main file to be executed, is src/main.py

# Dependencies
 - Pyglet 1.2.4

# TODOs
Playing around with gluLookAt and use it instead of translate and rotate the whole system by hand

If camera looks above, just the reference point is changed.
If the camera moves around, both reference and viewpoint are changed.

# Camera branch
On this branch the camera looking works partly. I've to finish playing around with gluLookAt, maybe it will work then.

Perspective "works" like in a First Person Shooter
